<!--## :thinking: How does it run ?


> [!NOTE]
> A better version with more features is coming... üèóÔ∏è

<!--## :test_tube: Features
- Implement AddTruck func logic

**********
With Gin
- Build a CRUD interface for /admin/trucks to manage trucks
- 		// database/database.go Fix: Prevent duplication of the previous query
		// about user_admin table
- Prevent database to begin with another integer than 1 for the first element in database.

- `session, err := models.Store.Get(r, "session-name")
			utils.ProcessError(err, w)` that line is repetitive in handlers/handlers.go and middlewares/middlewares.go
- Secure the app (Store into public folder only file client can visit)
- Avoid infinite session (set max time until user leave the application)
